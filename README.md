# Food_Delivery_App_Analysis

This project will help us understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using Python for better performance, and how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the dataset which is loaded in the database.


This project is divided into two parts:

●Module 1: Pre-precess the data using Python 

●Module 2: SQL for retrieving useful information from the database


Tools used for this project:
1.  SQL (MYSQL)
2.  Excel
